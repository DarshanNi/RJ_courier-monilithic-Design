# RJCouriers - Monolithic Web Application

RJCouriers is a simple **monolithic web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
All features such as **courier booking, package tracking, and service management** are developed within a single codebase.  

- **HTML** → Defines the structure of web pages  
- **CSS** → Provides styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** → Adds interactivity and client-side logic  

This monolithic design makes the application **easy to build and deploy**, but less scalable compared to microservices architecture.
